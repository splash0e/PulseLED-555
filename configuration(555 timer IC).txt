About 555-timer IC
The 555 Timer IC is one of the most popular and versatile integrated circuits ever created. 
Introduced by Signetics in 1972, it's widely used for timing, oscillation, and pulse generation applications.



Operates in 3 Modes & voltage Rating-

i) Astable – generates continuous pulses (oscillator)

ii) Monostable – generates a single pulse when triggered

iii) Bistable – works like a flip-flop (set/reset output)

iv) Wide operating voltage: 4.5V to 15V

v) Can source or sink up to 200 mA of current

vi) Precise timing with external resistors and capacitors

PIN Configuration-

| Pin | Name      | Description                          |
| --- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1   | GND       | Ground                               |
| 2   | Trigger   | Starts the timing cycle (active LOW) |
| 3   | Output    | Output signal                        |
| 4   | Reset     | Resets the timer (active LOW)        |
| 5   | Control   | Voltage control (usually bypassed)   |
| 6   | Threshold | Ends timing when voltage > ⅔ Vcc     |
| 7   | Discharge | Discharges timing capacitor          |
| 8   | Vcc       | Supply voltage (+5V to +15V)         |



# Common Applications:

LED flashers
Tone generators
PWM signal generators
Timed delays
Frequency modulation
Logic clocks
Alarm and timer circuits


Circuit mode-
Astable Mode: The 555 timer is wired in astable configuration, meaning it has no stable state — it continuously 
switches between HIGH and LOW. The LED turns ON during the HIGH cycle and OFF during the LOW cycle, creating a 
visible blinking pattern.
